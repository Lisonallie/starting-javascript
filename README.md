#### What it is ✍️✍️✍️
I was provided code with a series of exercises to learn different concepts of JavaScript.

#### Objectives 🔎🔎🔎
The exercises were intended to teach some basics of javascript and what it can do. The 8 exercises are:
1. Below this, you have an input, here's what you need to do:
  1. When you type something in the greetingsBox, The bordered box should fill with what you typed
  2. When you empty out the input box, show a "sorry nothing to show" message or a funny text
  
2. Part 2: DOM Creation on interaction with inputs
  1. Below this, you have a table, here are the instructions:
  2. When you press enter, check whether all fields have been filled (except remarks)
  3. If the first condition is met, create a row with this data and allow the user to fill in the next row 
  (so there should always be a row with empty inputs to fill in)
    Bonus: 
    1. If you press enter and the conditions aren't met, display a popup saying what's wrong with toastr
    2. Add a cross to the last cell, that when clicked, deletes the row again (Do NOT use the HTML onclick attribute!)

3. Part 3: Element alterations
Here is what you need to do, below me is a list:
  1. Fix it up so that it is an actual HTML list
  2. Make it so the user can type what he / she wants in the final option
  3. Launch the above transformation once the button (#launchMe) is pushed
    Bonus:
    1. "Choose your final ingredient" should be placed as placeholder text in the input when it's empty
    2. When you go away from the input (click somewhere else), if the input is not empty, it should change into a regular LI item with the content of the input

4. Part 4: Interaction with inputs
Below this, you have a table with some random data, here's what you need to do:
  1. When you type something in the searchInput, the table rows need to be filtered by the typed text
  2. Add checkboxes to each header (thead -> th ) when unchecked the columns disappear from the table (default = checked)
    Bonus:
    1. Highlight the found text in the table row

5. Part 5: Make it move
Below this, you have a div that needs to move left to right using JS for the motion. 
  1. Make it reach the end in 2 seconds, 
  2. then return in 5s. Repeat that forever.

6. Part 6: make it follow
  Below this, you have a div that 
  1. needs to move left to right using JS for the motion. 
  2. It should follow the mouse horizontally.

7.Part 7: Sliiiiiders
Recreate this very intuitive user interface. 
  1. Insert the DOM nodes (html elements) using document.createElement();

8. Part 8: Sliiiiiders again
  1. Put the exercise of above here again. 
  2. They should both keep working. 
  3. And you should only write one more line. In other words you cannot hard code ids 😉 
  4. If needed, rewrite the above code.
  
  
For these exercises in the provided time, I completed 1-4 and learned a lot about how to use JavaScript.
