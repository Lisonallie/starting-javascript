#### What it is ✍️✍️✍️
I was provided code with a series of exercises to learn different concepts of JavaScript.

#### Objectives 🔎🔎🔎
The exercises were intended to teach some basics of javascript and what it can do. The 8 exercises are:
1. Below this, you have an input, here's what you need to do:
  - When you type something in the greetingsBox, The bordered box should fill with what you typed
  - When you empty out the input box, show a "sorry nothing to show" message or a funny text
  
2. Part 2: DOM Creation on interaction with inputs
  - Below this, you have a table, here are the instructions:
  - When you press enter, check whether all fields have been filled (except remarks)
  - If the first condition is met, create a row with this data and allow the user to fill in the next row 
  (so there should always be a row with empty inputs to fill in)
    Bonus: 
    - If you press enter and the conditions aren't met, display a popup saying what's wrong with toastr
    - Add a cross to the last cell, that when clicked, deletes the row again (Do NOT use the HTML onclick attribute!)

3. Part 3: Element alterations
Here is what you need to do, below me is a list:
  - Fix it up so that it is an actual HTML list
  - Make it so the user can type what he / she wants in the final option
  - Launch the above transformation once the button (#launchMe) is pushed
    Bonus:
    - "Choose your final ingredient" should be placed as placeholder text in the input when it's empty
    - When you go away from the input (click somewhere else), if the input is not empty, it should change into a regular LI item with the content of the input

4. Part 4: Interaction with inputs
Below this, you have a table with some random data, here's what you need to do:
  - When you type something in the searchInput, the table rows need to be filtered by the typed text
  - Add checkboxes to each header (thead -> th ) when unchecked the columns disappear from the table (default = checked)
    Bonus:
    1. Highlight the found text in the table row

5. Part 5: Make it move
Below this, you have a div that needs to move left to right using JS for the motion. 
  - Make it reach the end in 2 seconds, 
  - then return in 5s. Repeat that forever.

6. Part 6: make it follow
  Below this, you have a div that 
  - needs to move left to right using JS for the motion. 
  - It should follow the mouse horizontally.

7.Part 7: Sliiiiiders
Recreate this very intuitive user interface. 
  - Insert the DOM nodes (html elements) using document.createElement();

8. Part 8: Sliiiiiders again
  - Put the exercise of above here again. 
  - They should both keep working. 
  - And you should only write one more line. In other words you cannot hard code ids 😉 
  - If needed, rewrite the above code.
  
  
For these exercises in the provided time, I completed 1-4 and learned a lot about how to use JavaScript.
